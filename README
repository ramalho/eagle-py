Eagle is an abstraction layer atop Graphical Toolkits focused on making simple
applications easy to build while powerful in features.

With Eagle you have many facilities to build applications that need just
a few buttons, user input and a canvas to draw on.

Canvas is really simple, which makes Eagle a great solution for Computer Graphics
and Image Processing software, the primary focus of this library.

User input data can be made persistent, you just need to mark the widgets "persistent" or
put them in the preferences area.

Eagle is not meant to be another Graphical Toolkit, you already have a bunch
of them, like Qt, Gtk, wxWidgets (to name just a few). It's focused on
applications that have few windows, with buttons, simple user input and canvas.
Widgets are laid out automatically in 5 areas: left, right, top, bottom and
center.

It provides useful widgets like: Color selector, Font selector, Quit button,
Preferences button and dialog, About dialog and Help dialog.

Eagle now supports multiple platforms: gtk, qt and maemo, please refer to each
directory for specific information.
