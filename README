Eagle is an abstraction layer atop Graphical Toolkits focused on making simple
applications easy to build while powerful in features.

With Eagle you have many facilities to build application that needs just
some buttons, user input and a canvas to draw.

Canvas is really simple, what makes Eagle a great solution to Computer Graphics
and Image Processing software, the primary focus of this library.

User input widgets are persistent, you just need to mark them "persistent" or
put them in the preferences area.

Eagle is not meant to be another Graphical Toolkit, you already have a bunch
of them, like Qt, Gtk, wxWidgets (to name just a few). It's focused on
applications that have few windows, with buttons, simple user input and canvas.
Widgets are laid out automatically in 5 areas: left, right, top, bottom and
center.

It provides useful widgets like: Color selector, Font selector, Quit button,
Preferences button and bialog, About dialog and Help dialog.
