These are items to be done in next versions of Eagle.

If Eagle doesn't provide the features you want and they are not
in this file, please contact barbieri@gmail.com and explain your needs.

BUGS TO FIX
===========

 * Widgets alignment know about layout. Ie: _EGWidLabelEntry's label
   would align to the right in vertical and to the left in horizontal.
 * Fix remaining space to hold horizontal scrollbar even when there is
   no scrollbar visible (probably bug with GTK).


FEATURES
========

 * Menubar
 * Toolbar
 * User defined areas and layouts
 * Dynamic UI composition (add/remove widgets after App is created)
 * Automatic thread handling
