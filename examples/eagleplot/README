                              =========

EaglePlot  is  a simple  application  using  Gustavo Barbieri's  eagle
python library. It's intended to plot general parametric curves in two
dimensions  efficiently,  using and  adaptive  sampling method  [F95],
which samples just the necessary number of points so that the curve is
drawn smoothly, and is quickly updated.

To  plot  some  function you  just  enter  the  values  for x  and  y,
parametrized by t whose interval must also be entered. And you can set
the other options as you like.

Of course,  one can also  plot non-parametric functions,  because they
can be trivially converted to  a parametric one. For instance, suppose
you want to plot f(x) = (x-1)*(x-3)*(x-4), in the interval 0.5 <= x <=
4.5, you just convert it to a  parametric curve by making x(t) = t and
y(t) = f(t) in the interval 0.5  <= t <= 4.5. Note that you don't need
to specify the vertical range  that you graph will be plotted, because
it will be automatically discovered.

The application  will also deal with asymptotes  gracefully, just like
some other symbolic computation software.

And now  a complex parametric curve,  a kind of  epicycloid. There are
some other  examples that you  can readily try  just by choosing  on a
drop down menu, and of course any other curve you can enter.
